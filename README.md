## How to run dev server locally

Users can run this locally by following [the README in simonsobs/lightserve](https://github.com/simonsobs/lightserve) to run the server (requires Docker Desktop, as well).

Once the server is running locally, do the following:

```js
    git clone git@github.com:simonsobs/lightserve.git
    cd lightserve
    npm install
    npm run dev
```
